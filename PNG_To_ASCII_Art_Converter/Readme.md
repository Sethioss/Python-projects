# Image file to ASCII art converter

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tool allows you to convert any image file into an ASCII art of the said image in two formats. A .txt file for copypasting, and a .png file for sending or uploading as an image.  

## Usage  

Upon launching the program, choose an image to convert into ASCII art. The original image will be copied in the "image_resources" folder, and the ASCII art outputs will be stored in the "ASCII_results" folder.  
DO NOT CHANGE THE NAMES OF THESE FOLDERS  

## Resizing

The program will ask you if you want a specific resize for your image. This size corresponds to the number of character per line in the .txt file, not the number of pixels.  
If you choose "No", the image will be automatically resized to the base width, which corresponds to 510 characters per line.  
If you choose "Yes", a number between 1 and 510 will be needed from the user. The image will proportionally be resized to fit the length provided by the user.  

Keep in mind that a larger width will increase the final output's precision, but also the png generation time

### Examples

All images belong to their respective owners (The ASCII art txt files are available in the source project)
